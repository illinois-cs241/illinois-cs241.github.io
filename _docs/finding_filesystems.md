## Introduction / Backstory

So you've been doing well at Macrohard. Your turbo malloc really impressed your boss and you also went on to work on the infamous password cracker and parmake programs. However, your bosses have been looking for a way to store data in a proprietary format so that they can easily share chunks of data without having to first compress it. They have the following requirements:

+ The data must be stored in a single file so that it's easy to share - however, to keep the file within the company the format must be proprietary
+ Current tools like `cp`, `ls`, `touch`, etc must work with this data format for easy usage

Sounds tough. That second requirement really throws a spin on things. It's such an arbitrary requirement. Almost as if it was just thrown in as a TA's lazy writing to motivate an MP or something. Lame!

Of course, as a student of CS341, you know exactly what they're asking for - a loopback filesystem! After doing some research, you decide that a good filesystem to base your implementation off of is minixfs. Your friendly coworkers have already made some progress on this project and created a filesystem wrapper, fakefs, that can load a mininxfs image. It's now your job to implement a few filesystem operations for minix.

In this MP, you will be implementing several callbacks to file system operations, namely, `chmod`, `chown`, `read`, and `write`. To do this you will be exploring how metadata is stored in the inode and how data is stored in the data blocks. You will also be exploring the idea of virtual filesystems and how they can be used to present metadata about a system.

## minixfs

ext2 is good filesystem, but to keep things simple, we will be using a modified version of its predecessor (the [MINIX filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX_file_system)) in this MP.

### file_system struct

```
typedef struct {
  superblock* meta;
  inode* inode_root;
  data_block* data_root;
} file_system;

```

![Finding Map](../images/assignment-docs/mp/finding_filesystems/map.png)

The `file_system` struct keeps track of the metadata, the root inode (where `fs->inode_root[0]` is the root `"/"` inode), and the root of the `data_block`s.

* The `meta` pointer points to the start of the file system, which includes the superblock.
* The `inode_root` points to the start of the inodes as in the picture.
* The `data_root` points to the start of the `data_blocks` as in the picture, right after the inodes.
* The `data_map` keeps track of which blocks are used and is placed at the end of the filesystem which makes it easy to resize the filesystem (although resizing is not supported by your implementation). Remember from class that inodes become free when their hard link count reaches zero, but data blocks need some kind of bitmap or sentinel to indicate if they are being used. `data_map` is a variable-sized array that holds this information. **You don't need to worry about these abstractions, they are taken care of for you**.

The inodes and data blocks are laid sequentially out so you can treat them like an array. Think about how you could get a pointer to the nth `data_block`.

### Superblock

```
typedef struct {
  uint64_t size;
  uint64_t inode_count;
  uint64_t dblock_count;
} superblock;
```

The superblock stores information like the size of the filesystem, the number of inodes, and the number of data blocks. 

### Inodes

```
typedef struct {
  uid_t uid;
  gid_t gid;
  uint16_t mode;
  uint32_t nlink;
  struct timespec atim;
  struct timespec mtim;
  struct timespec ctim;
  uint64_t size;
  data_block_number direct[NUM_DIRECT_BLOCKS];
  data_block_number indirect;
} inode;
```

This is the famous inode struct that you have been learning about! Here are a breakdown of the variables:

- `uid` is the user ID of the inode owner.
- `gid` is the ID of the inode group (does not have to include the owner).
- `mode` is a bitmask. The bottom 9 bits are read-write-execute for owner-group-others. Bits 11-10 are the type of the file. `(mode >> 9)` corresponds to a particular type. We have given you two functions, `is_file` and `is_directory`, that tell you whether or not the inode represents a directory or file. There are no other types in our filesystem.
- `nlink` is the hard link count which is the number of directories that the file is linked to from (directories can't be hard linked).
- `atim` is access time, which is the time of last access or the last time a file was `read(2)`.
- `mtim` is the last modification time, or in other words, the last time the file was changed with `write(2)`.
- `ctim` is the last change time, or in other words, the last time the file's metadata was changed.
- `size` is the size of the file in bytes
- `direct` is an array where  `direct[i]` is the `i`th data block's offset ( `data_block_number`) from the `data_root`.
- `indirect` is the offset number (`data_block_number`) of a data block, which contains `NUM_INDIRECT_BLOCKS` number of `data_block_number`'s.

We are using the direct and indirect members of the inode to index our data blocks, which works like so.

### Data blocks

```
typedef struct {
  char data[16 * KILOBYTE];
} data_block;

```

Data blocks are currently defined to be 16 kilobytes. Nothing fancy here.

## fakefs interface

You do not to modify or read any of the code in `fakefs_src/`.

To make this MP possible, we've developed our own userspace filesystem interface which we're calling fakefs. Normally, filesystems are a piece of code which you load into your kernel and must provide a few things. It needs a constructor, destructor, callbacks for all system calls involving files and file descriptors within your filesystem. However, writing kernel code is a bit more cumbersome than writing normal code since you need additional security checks among other things, and can even lead to instability in your operating system. To avoid this, there are various ways to implment a filesystem in userspace. The most common (and preferred) method is to use a library called FUSE (Filesystems in USErspace). FUSE allows you to implement your file operations in userspace, but still interacts with the kernel to provide it's functionality. While this allows you to mount the filesystem and use it like any other filesystem, there are a few reasons why we chose not to use it for this MP. A major reason is that if a FUSE callback crashes while it is mounted, it renders the mounted partition unusable and in some cases, you won't be able to even unmount the partition without rebooting the machine. To prevent making this MP annoying and tedious, we've made our own way of implementing filesystems in userspace by `hooking` filesystem operations.

If you take a look at `fakefs_src/fakefs.c` you'll see that we've overridden most of `glibc`'s filesystem operations. Note that this only hooks functions from code or programs that were either written in `C` or in something that compiles to `C`. Running a program written in assembly will not be affected by these hooks.

Note that not all programs will work with fakefs. At the least, we guarantee that `ls`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `unlink` and `cp` work. `vim` and `neovim` seem to work although you might run into some weird bugs using these programs within fakefs.

TL;DR: running a program with fakefs will replace  `glibc`'s filesystem operations with your own functions. Make sure you use this when testing your code.

## Helper Functions/Macros

There are some functions that you are going to need to know in order to finish this MP.

### `get_inode`

This function takes a string name like `/path/to/file` and returns the inode corresponding to the file at the end of that path. `get_inode` returns NULL when the intended file does not exist or the file is invalid.

### `is_file` / `is_directory`

Call `is_file` or `is_directory` on an inode to tell whether it is a directory or a file. You don't need to consider other inode types.

### `is_virtual_path`

Call `is_virtual_path` on a path to see if it's a path in the virtual component. If it is, this function will return a path relative to the virtual directory. Returns `NULL` otherwise.

### `minixfs_min_blockcount`

Call `minixfs_min_blockcount` to ensure that an inode has a certain minimum number of data blocks directly, or indirectly, associated with it.

### `NUM_DIRECT_BLOCKS`

`NUM_DIRECT_BLOCKS` is the number of direct `data_block` nodes in a single inode. The `indirect` array also has this many entries (for the sake of simplicity).

### `UNASSIGNED_NODE`

You may not need to use this macro, but if you choose to, then any `data_block` or `inode` that is not currently being used will have this number.

### Other useful functions

* `make_string_from_dirent`
* `add_single_indirect_block`
* `add_data_block_to_indirect_block`
* `add_data_block_to_inode`
* `parent_directory`
* `init_inode`

You can find information about these in `minixfs.h` and `minixfs_utils.h`. It's also a good idea to read through the provided functions briefly (at least the headers) to get an idea of what tools we provide you with.


## So what do I need to do?

You will need to implement the following 5 functions

* `int minixfs_chmod(file_system *fs, char *path, int new_permissions)`
* `int minixfs_chown(file_system *fs, char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group)`
* `inode *minixfs_create_inode_for_path(file_system *fs, const char *path)`
* `ssize_t minixfs_read(file_system *fs, const char *path, void *buf, size_t req, off_t *off)`
* `ssize_t minixfs_write(file_system *fs, const char *path, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t *off)`

And you will need to implement a virtual file `/virtual/info`. For more information about that, scroll down to the virtual filesystem section.

You can find more information about the required functions in `minixfs.h`. Remember to set `errno` on errors in your code!! We will be checking errno while grading.

Note that for all functions where you need to update times, you should use `clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, variable_to_update);`.

## Some notes on `minixfs_create_inode_for_path`

Since we've had many students ask about this function, this section will
contain some hints.

Note that the parent directory of a path passed in will always exist when we
test your code.

A valid file path is absolute, unique, and links to a directory containing a file with a valid filename.

When you find an unused inode, you will need to use `init_inode` to initialize
it.

`make_string_from_dirent` will write the contents of a  `minixfs_dirent` to the `char *`  you provide.

The number of bytes written by calling `make_string_from_dirent` will be equal to
`FILE_NAME_ENTRY` as defined in `minixfs.h`

## Virtual Filesystem

In order to quickly get meta-information about the filesystem, we're going to implement a virtual filesystem. Virtual filesystems are filesystems that present file-like objects, but don't provide access to data in the traditional sense that you would expect from a filesystem. Some examples are `procfs` (usually mounted at `/proc`) that gives a user information about running processes, and also has some special files that can control various system parameters or provide debugging information about a running machine, or `devfs` (usually mounted at `/dev`) that provides information about devices and presents some virtual devices such as `dev/zero`, `/dev/random` and `/dev/null` which have special actions when being read or written to.

The virtual filesystem we will be baking into our mininxfs implementation will live at `/virtual` with respect to the root of your minix filesystem. There will be at least one file inside, `info`. You do not need to implement writing to `/virtual/info`, but do need to support read. When read from, `/virtual/info` will return a string with the following format:

```
Free blocks: [number of free blocks]
Used blocks: [number of used blocks]
```

Note that there is a new line at the end of each line above. You will need to compute the number of free and used blocks to insert into the data. Also note that you will need to support reading the virtual file from an offset, and must not copy more bytes to the user's buffer than requested (just like a normal read).

To simplify your implementation we recommend first generating the data above as a string and then copying a certain number of bytes of the string from a desired offset to the user buffer.

## Testing

**Testing is ungraded, but highly recommended**

You can grab the test filesystem using `make testfs`. **Do not commit this file. If you overwrite it and want the original version just `rm test.fs` and do `make testfs` again**

You will probably want to reset your `test.fs` file frequently while testing your write functionality.

Note: There's a small chance that `make testfs` can fail - in this case `rm test.fs` and `make testfs` again.

`make` will generate the minixfs_test executable that you can use for testing. We strongly recommend writing your own testcases in `minixfs_test.c` and not just using the output of commands like `ls` and `cat` (which we describe how to test with below). This is because subtle bugs in your code can make the output look right, but have random unprintable characters as well.

The `goodies` directory is also included and can also be used to check against the /goodies directory in test.fs.
For example, the output of:
`./fakefs test.fs cat test.fs/goodies/hello.txt` should be the same as `cat ./goodies/hello.txt`

Here are some sample (and not comprehensive) testcases!

```
$ ./fakefs test.fs cat test.fs/goodies/hello.txt
Hello World!
$
```

You can even cat directories!

```
$ ./fakefs test.fs cat test.fs/
you00000001got00000002ls!00000003congrats00000004 [...]
$
```

So that's what really is going on under the hood?

You can also use the /goodies directory in `minixfs_test.c`. Here's an example:

```    
char * buffer = calloc(1, 13);
file_system *fs = open_fs("test.fs");
off_t off = 0;
char buf[13];
ssize_t bytes_read = minixfs_read(fs, "/goodies/hello.txt", buf, 13, &off);
char *expected[13];
//open /goodies/hello.txt with open() or fopen() and read the contents way you normally would
assert(!strcmp(buf, expected));
close_fs(&fs);
```

Want something fun?

```
$ ./fakefs test.fs cat test.fs/goodies/dog.png > dog.png
$ xdg-open dog.png

```

You can store anything on filesystems. See what we hid around the testfs filesystem for you...

You can also test by generating your own filesystems. Simply run ./fakefs mkfs _filename_ to generate a filesystem with the filename _filename_. If you've implemented the write functionality, you can use commands like ./fakefs cp _file1_ _filename_/ to copy files over. programs like `mkdir` should work as well.

## Other Edge Cases

* You do need to update `atim` and the `ctim`!
* You don't need to worry about data corruption or checksums or anything fancy, the filesystem will be valid. (Unless your write has bugs in it)
* Make sure all the files you cat out in `/goodies` look correct when you `xdg-open` them. Make sure you can get the PNGs and the PDFs to print out correctly.
* Make sure your output is the same size as the files inside the filesystem. You can check this by running stat on the files inside the filesystem(`./fakefs test.fs stat test.fs/FILE_PATH`), and wc -c on the on output of running cat on the file (`./fakefs test.fs cat test.fs/FILE_PATH | wc -c`) to check that the number of bytes is the same.


## Helpful Hints and Notes

*   Handle the edge conditions. You can assume that size will be valid. What is the code supposed to do when you get to a singly indirect block?
*   Draw pictures! Understand what each of the things in the structs mean.
*   Review your pointer arithmetic.
*   **Only** change`minixfs.c`.
