Malloc Blues By Angrave (with help from ChatGPT and Suno)

Lyrics - 
(Intro)
My papa said stay away from unsafe C; 
A coder like you needs security!
My mama warned me of low-level types;
You'll never be happy with compilation fights!
But here I am coding close to the metal.
My quickening heart will never settle.
I'm in love with C but will it ever love me?

(Chorus)
So I'm singing the blues of malloc and C,
Boundary tags for my calloc and free?
Block coalescing and a placement strategy.
I'm in love with C but will it ever love me?

(verse)
Well, I'm just a coder, with C as my muse,
In a heap of trouble, with placement blues.
From syntax errors, to my bugs so deep,
Every line I write, I'm being bitten by the heap.

(Chorus)
So I'm singing the blues of malloc and C,
Boundary tags for my calloc and free?
Block coalescing and a placement strategy.
I'm in love with C but will it ever love me?


My friends they like abstraction
And constructing an exception.
But my fingers desire that raw connection
to know and touch it all is just perfection.
So though my future will be more dignified
C will live forever burning me inside
for my passion remains unanswered
I'm in love with C but will it ever love me?
I'm in love with C but will it ever love me?
 
(Instrumental)

Lyrics 
by Lawrence Angrave (4/18/2024), based on initial suggestions using ChatGPT3 prompt
"write a first person song lyrics for an upbeat blues song about challenges, woes and satisfaction of writing and debugging a single-threaded high performance implementation of malloc in C. Some ideas that could be included: I got a whole heap of trouble. Boundary tags. Free lists.  Difficulties of Block Coalescing. When to block split. Failing unit tests. Free. Tests timing out. Loving C Programming. Hating C Programming. Asserts. Null Pointers. Pointer arithmetic. Sentinel values. Also Implementing Realloc and calloc. Late nights. Frustration. Learning"

For comparison, the ChatGPT output is below-
(Verse 1)
Well, I'm just a coder, in a world of woes,
Got a mountain of troubles, yeah, it surely shows.
From the breakneck pace, to the bugs so deep,
Every line I write, it's like dancing on a steep.

(Chorus)
I'm singing the blues of malloc in C,
Boundary tags, and free lists, won't you set me free?
Block coalescing, oh, what a fight,
But when it all works out, it's a pure delight.

(Verse 2)
Late nights and frustration, they're my closest friends,
But I keep on pushing, until the journey ends.
Unit tests failing, timing out on me,
But I won't give up, till my code's debris-free.

(Chorus)
I'm singing the blues of malloc in C,
Asserts and null pointers, they're haunting me.
Pointer arithmetic, it's a perilous ride,
But when it all clicks, I've got nothing to hide.

(Bridge)
I love C programming, and I hate it too,
But the satisfaction it brings, is oh so true.
Implementing realloc, and calloc too,
Oh, the highs and lows, they're nothing new.

(Verse 3)
Sentinel values, they guide my way,
Through the maze of memory, where I often stray.
Debugging each line, with a keen eye,
Hoping for that moment, when it all will comply.

(Chorus)
I'm singing the blues of malloc in C,
Through the darkness and the light, I will be.
With every challenge faced, I learn and grow,
In the world of coding, that's how we flow.

(Outro)
So here's to the journey, with all its highs and lows,
Writing and debugging, till the solution glows.
For in the end, it's the satisfaction earned,
In the world of malloc, where the fire still burns.
