Lyrics
Edge triggered, wake up, don't stall,
Handling data, we heed the call.
Epoll wait, no more delay,
One thread, one socket, in our relay.

Level triggered, a constant flow,
But edge triggered's where we go.
Half processed, then a wakeup call,
Epoll returns, data for all.

Edge triggered, wake up, don't stall,
Handling data, we heed the call.
Epoll wait, no more delay,
One thread, one socket, in our relay.

Threads blocking, on one descriptor's reign,
Data arrives, causing a chain.
Multiple wakes, a chaotic spree,
Edge triggered ensures only one to see.

Edge triggered, wake up, don't stall,
Handling data, we heed the call.
Epoll wait, no more delay,
One thread, one socket, in our relay.

EPOLLONESHOT flag, our trusty guide,
No more accidental thread collide.
Complexity, but peace we find,
In edge triggered mode, our data bind.

Edge triggered, wake up, don't stall,
Handling data, we heed the call.
Epoll wait, no more delay,
One thread, one socket, in our relay.

So why edge triggered? Now you know,
In the chaos, it's our bow.
Guaranteed handling, in our thread's sight,
Edge triggered, our guiding light.
