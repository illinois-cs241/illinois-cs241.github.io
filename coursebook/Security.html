<p><strong>Hackers Are Like Artists, Who Wake Up In A Good Mood &amp; Start
Painting</strong> - <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong></p>

<p>Computer security is the protection of hardware and software from
unauthorized access or modification. Even if you don’t work directly in
the computer security field, the concepts are important to learn because
all systems will have attackers given enough time. Even though this is
introduced as a different chapter, it is important to note that most of
these concepts and code examples have already been introduced at
different points in the course. We won’t go in depth about all of the
common ways of attack and defense nor will we go into how to perform all
of these attacks in an arbitrary system. Our goal is to introduce you to
the field of making programs do what you want to do.</p>

<div class="pad"><div class="card">
<div class="title"><h2 id="security-terminology-and-ethics" class="title-text">Security Terminology and Ethics<a class="anchor title-text" href="#security-terminology-and-ethics"> #</a>
</h2></div>























<div class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="content col-sm-11 .col-sm-offset-1">
<p>There is some terminology that needs to be explained to get someone who
has little to no experience in computer security up to speed</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An <strong>Attacker</strong> is typically the user who is trying to break into
the system. Breaking into the system means performing an action that
the developer of the system didn’t intend. It could also mean
accessing a system you shouldn’t have access to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>Defender</strong> is typically the user who is preventing the attacker
from breaking into the system. This may be the developer of the
system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are different types of attackers. There are <strong>white hat</strong>
hackers who attempt to hack a defender with their consent. This is
commonly a form of pre-emptive testing – in case a not-so-friendly
attack comes along. The <strong>black hat</strong> hackers are hackers who hack
without permission and the intent to use the information obtained
for any purpose. Gray hat hacking differs because the hacker’s
intent is to inform the defender of the vulnerability – though this
can be hard to judge at times.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Danger Will Robinson</strong> Before we let you go much further, it is
important that we talk about ethics. Before you skip over this section,
know that your career quite literally can be terminated over an
unethical decision that you might make. The computer fraud and security
act is a broad, and arguably terrible law, that casts any non-authorized
use of a ‘protected computer’ of a computer as a felony. Since most
computers are involved in some interstate/international commerce (the
internet) most computers fall under this category. It is important to
think about your actions and have some ladder of accountability before
executing any attack or defense. To be more concrete, make sure
supervisors in your organization have given you their blessing before
trying to execute an attack.</p>
<p>First if at all possible, get written permission from one of your
superiors. We do realize that this is a cop-out and this puts the blame
up a level, but at the risk of sounding cynical organizations will often
put blame on an individual employee to avoid damages TODO: <strong>Citation
Needed</strong>. If not possible, try to go through the engineering steps</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Figure out what the problem is that you are trying to solve. You
can’t solve a problem that you don’t fully understand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Determine whetheryou need to “hack” the system. A hack is defined
generally as trying to use a system unintendedly. First, you should
determine if your use is intended or unintended or somewhere in the
middle – get a decision for them. If you can’t get that, make a
reasonable judgement as to what the intended use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figure out a reasonable estimate of what the cost is to “hacking”
the system. Get that reasonable estimate checked out with a few
engineers so they can highlight things that you may have missed. Try
to get someone to sign off on the plan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute the plan with caution. If at any point something seems
wrong, weigh the risks and execute the plan.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If there isn’t a certain ethical guideline for the current application,
then create some. This is often called a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">policy vacuum</code>. This may seem
like busy work and more on the “business side” than computer scientists
are used to, but your career is at stake here. It is up to you as a
computing professional to assess the risk and to decide whether to
execute. Courts generally like sitting on precedent, but you can easily
say that you aren’t a legal scholar. In lieu, you must be able to say
that you reacted as a “reasonable” engineer would react.</p>
<p>TODO: <strong>Link to some case studies of real engineers having to decide</strong></p>
<h3 id="cia-triad" class="title-text">CIA Triad</h3>
<p>There are three commonly accepted goals to help understand if a system
is secure.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Information Confidentiality means that only authorized parties are
allowed to see a piece of information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information Integrity means that only authorized parties are allowed
the modify a piece of information, regardless of whether they are
allowed to see it. It ensures that information remains in complete
during transit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information Availability means information, or a service, is
available when it is needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The triad above forms the Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability (CIA) triad, often authenticity is added as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If any of these are broken, the security of a system (either a service
or piece of information) has been compromised.</p>

<h3 id="stack-smashing" class="title-text">Stack Smashing</h3>
<p>Consider the following code snippet</p>
<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">greeting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="n">strcpy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, %s!</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">buf</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argc</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="n">greeting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>There is no checking on the bounds of strcpy! This means that we could
potentially pass in a large string and get the program to do something
unintended, usually via replacing the return address of the function
with the address of malicious code. Most strings will cause the program
to exit with a segmentation fault</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./a.out john
Hello, john!
$ ./a.out JohnAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If we manipulate the bytes in certain ways and the program was compiled
with the correct flags, we can actually get access to a shell! Consider
if that file is owned by root, we put in some valid bytecode (binary
instructions) as the string. What will happen is we’ll try to execute
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execve(’/bin/sh’, ’/bin/sh’, NULL , NULL)</code> that is compiled to the
bytecode of the operating system and pass it as part of our string. With
some luck, we will get access to a root shell.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./a.out &lt;payload&gt;
root#
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The question arises, which parts of the triad does this break? Try to
answer that question yourself. So how would we go about fixing this? We
could ingrain into most programmers at the C level to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/./man3/strncpy.3p.html" class="fancy-link">strncpy</a></code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strlcpy</code> on OpenBSD systems. Turning on stack canaries as explained
later will fix this issue as well.</p>
<h3 id="buffer-overflow" class="title-text">Buffer Overflow</h3>
<p>Most of you are already familiar with Buffer Overflows! A lot of time
they are fairly tame, leading to simple program crashes or funny
mistakes. Here is a complete example</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; cat main.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char out[10];
    char in[10];
    fscanf(stdin, "%s", in);
    out[0] = 'a';
    out[9] = '\0';
    printf("%s\n", out);

    return 0;
}
&gt; gcc main.c -fno-stack-protector # need the special flag otherwise won't work
# Stack protectors are explained later.
&gt; ./a.out
hello
a
&gt; ./a.out
hellloooooooo
aoo
&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>What happens here should be clear if you recall the c memory model. Out
and in are both next to each other in memory. If you read in a string
from standard input that overflows in, then you end up printing aoo. It
gets a little more serious if the snippet starts out as</p>
<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="n">read_user_password</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pass_hash</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="out-of-order-instructions--spectre" class="title-text">Out of order instructions &amp; Spectre</h3>
<p>Out of order execution is an amazing development that has been recently
adopted by many hardware vendors (think 1990s) TODO: <strong>citation
needed</strong>. Processors now instead of executing a sequence of instructions
(let’s say assigning a variable and then another variable) execute
instructions before the current one is done (Guide
<a href="#ref-guide2011intel" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-guide2011intel</a> P. 45). This is
because modern processors spend a lot of time waiting for memory
accesses and other I/O driven applications. This means that a processor,
while it is waiting for an operation to complete, will execute the next
few operations. If any of the operations would possibly alter the final
result, there is a barrier, or if the re-ordering violates the data
dependencies of the instructions, the processor keep the instructions in
the stated order (Guide
<a href="#ref-guide2011intel" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-guide2011intel</a> P. 296).</p>
<p>Naturally, this allowed CPUs to become more energy-efficient while
executing more instructions in real-time and increased security risks
from complex architectures. What system programmers are worried about is
that operation with mutex locks among threads are out of order – meaning
that a pure software implementation of a mutex will fail without copious
memory barriers. Therefore, the programmer has to acknowledge that
updates may be missed among a series of threads, given that there is no
barrier, on modern processors.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent bugs concerning this is Spectre (Kocher et al.
<a href="#ref-kocher2018spectre" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-kocher2018spectre</a>). Spectre is
a bug where instructions that otherwise wouldn’t be executed are
speculatively executed due to out-of-order instruction execution. The
following snippet is a high-level proof of concept.</p>

<p>Let’s analyze this code. The first loop allocates 9 elements through a
valid malloc. The last element is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xCAFE</code>, meaning a dereference should
result in a SEGFAULT. For the first 9 iterations, the branch is taken
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/./man1/val.1p.html" class="fancy-link">val</a></code> is assigned to a valid value. The interesting part happens in
the last iteration. The resulting behavior of the program is to skip the
last iteration. Therefore, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/./man1/val.1p.html" class="fancy-link">val</a></code> never gets assigned to the last value.</p>
<p>But under the right compilation conditions and compiler flags, the
instructions will be speculatively executed. The processor thinks that
the branch will be taken, since it has been taken in the last 9
iterations. As such, the processor will fetch those instructions. Due to
out-of-order instruction execution, while the value of <em>i</em> is being
fetched from memory, we have to force it not to be in a register. Then,
the processor will try to dereference that address. This should result
in a SEGFAULT. Since the address was never logically reached by the
program, the result is discarded.</p>
<p>Now here is the trick. Even though the value of the calculation would
have resulted in a SEGFAULT, the bug doesn’t clear the cache that refers
to the physical memory where 0xCAFE is located. This is an inexact
explanation, but essentially how it works. Since it is still in the
cache, if you again trick the processor to read form the cache using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/./man1/val.1p.html" class="fancy-link">val</a></code> then you will read a memory value that you wouldn’t be able to
read normally. This could include important information such as
passwords, payment information, etc.</p>
<h3 id="operating-systems-security" class="title-text">Operating Systems Security</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Permissions. In POSIX systems, we have permissions everywhere. There
are directories that you can and can’t access, files that you can
and can’t access. Each user account is given access to each file and
directory through the read-write-execute (RWX) bits. The user gets
matched with either the owner, the group, or ‘everyone else’, and
their access to the file is limited using these bits. Note that
permissions work slightly differently on directories compared to
files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capabilities. In addition to permissions on files, each user has a
certain set of permissions that they can do. For a full list, you
can check capabilities(7). In short, allowing a capability allows a
user to perform a set of actions. Some examples include controlling
networking devices, creating special files, and peering into IPC or
interprocess communication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). ASLR causes the address
spaces of important sections of a process, including the base
address of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap and
libraries, to start at randomized values, on every run. This is so
that an attacker with a running executable has to randomly guess
where sensitive information could be hidden. For example, an
attacker may use this to easily perform a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return-to-libc</code> attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stack Protectors. Let’s say you’ve programmed a buffer overflow as
above. In most cases, what happens? Unless specifically turned off,
the compiler will put in stack protectors or stack canaries. This is
a value that resides in the stack and must remain constant for the
duration of the function call. If that protector is overwritten at
the end of the function call, the run time will abort and report to
the user that stack smashing was detected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write xor Execute, also known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data Execution Prevention</code> (DEP).
This is a protection that was covered in the IPC section that
distinguishes code from data. A page can either be written to or
executed but not both. This is to prevent buffer overflows where
attackers write arbitrary code, often stored on the stack or heap,
and execute with the user’s permissions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firewall. The Linux kernel provides the netfilter module as a way of
deciding whetheran incoming connection should be allowed and various
other restrictions on connections. This can help with a DDOS attack
(explained later).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AppArmor. AppArmor is a suite of operating system tools at the
userspace level to restrict applications to certain operations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>OpenBSD is an arguably better system for security. It has many security
oriented features. Some of these features have been touched upon
earlier. An exhaustive list of features is at
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html" class="fancy-link wiki-link">https://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>pledge. Pledge is a powerful command that restricts system calls.
This means if you have a simple program like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/./man1/cat.1p.html" class="fancy-link">cat</a></code> which only reads
to and from files, one can reasonably restrict all network access,
pipe access, and write access to files. This is known as the process
of “hardening” an executable or system, giving the smallest amount
of permissions to the least number of executables needed to run a
system. Pledge is also useful in case one tries to perform an
injection attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unveil. Unveil is a system call that restricts the access of a
current program to a few directories. Those permissions apply to all
forked programs as well. This means if you have a suspicious
executable that you want to run whose description is “creates a new
file and outputs random words” one could use this call to restrict
access to a safe subdirectory and watch it receive the SIGKILL
signal if it tries to access system files in the root directory, for
example. This could be useful for your program as well. If you want
to ensure that no user data is lost during an update (which is what
happened with a Steam system update), then the system could only
reveal the program’s installation directory. If an attacker manages
to find an exploit in the executable, it can only compromise the
installation directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sudo. Sudo is an openBSD project that runs everywhere! Before to
run commands as root, one would have to drop to a root shell. Some
times that would also mean giving users scary system capabilities.
Sudo gives you access to perform commands as root for one-offs
without giving a long list of capabilities to all of your users.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="virtualization-security" class="title-text">Virtualization Security</h3>
<p>Virtualization is the act of creating a virtual version of an
environment for a program to run on. Though that definition might be
bent a little with the advent of new-age bare metal Virtual Machines,
the abstraction is still there. One can imagine a single Operating
System per motherboard. Virtualization in the software sense is
providing “virtual” motherboard features like USB ports or monitors that
another program (the bridge) communicates with the actual hardware to
perform a task. A simple example is running a virtual machine on your
host desktop! One can spin up an entirely different operating system
whose instructions are fed through another program and executed on the
host system. There are many forms of virtualization that we use today.
We will discuss two popular forms below. One form is virtual machines.
These programs emulate <em>all</em> forms of motherboard peripherals to create
a full machine. Another form is containers. Virtual machines are good
but are often bulky and programs only need a certain level of
protection. Containers are virtual machines that don’t emulate all
motherboard peripherals and instead share with the host operating
system, adding in additional layers of security.</p>
<p>Now, you can’t have proper virtualization without security. One of the
reasons to have virtualization is to ensure that the virtualized
environment doesn’t maliciously leak back into the host environment. We
say maliciously because there are intended ways of communication that we
want to keep in check. Here are some simple examples of security
provided through virtualization</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>chroot is a contrived way of creating a virtualization environment.
chroot is short for change root. This changes where a program
believes that (/) is mounted on the system. For example with chroot,
one can make a hello world program believe <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/user/</code> is actually
the root directory. This is useful because no other files are
exposed. This is contrived because Linux still needs additional
tools (think the c standard library) to come from different
directories such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/lib</code> which means those could still be
vulnerable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>namespaces are Linux’s better way to create a virtualization
environment. We won’t go into this too much, just know that they
exist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hardware virtualization technology. Hardware vendors have become
increasingly aware that physical protections are needed when
emulating instructions. As such, there can be switches enabled by
the user that allows the operating system to flip into a
virtualization mode where instructions are run as normal but are
monitored for malicious activity. This helps the performance and
increases the security of virtualized environments.</p>

<p>Cyber Security is arguably the most popular area of security. More and
more of our systems are hacked over the web, it is important to
understand how we can protect against these attacks</p>
<h3 id="security-at-the-tcp-level" class="title-text">Security at the TCP Level</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Encryption. <strong>TCP is unencrypted!</strong> This means any data that is
sent over a TCP connection is in plain text. If one needs to send
encrypted data, one needs to use a higher level protocol such as
HTTPs or develop their own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identity Verification. In TCP, there is no way to verify the
identity of who the program is connecting to. There are no checks or
federated databases in place. One just has to trust the DNS server
gave a reasonable response which is almost always the incorrect
answer. Apart from systems that have an approved white list or a
“secret” connection protocol, there is little at the TCP level
that one can do to stop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Syn-Ack Sequence Number. This is a security improvement. TCP
features what we call sequence numbers. That means that during the
SYN-SYN/ACK-ACK dance, a connection starts at a random integer. This
is important because if an attacker is trying to spoof packets
(pretend those packets are coming from your program) that means that
the attacker must either correctly guess – which is hard – or be in
the route that your packet takes to the destination – much more
likely. ISPs help out with the destination problem because it may
send a connection through varying routers which makes it hard for an
attacker to sit anywhere and be sure that they will receive your
packets – this is why security experts usually advise against using
coffee shop wifi for sensitive tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Syn-Flood. Before the first synchronization packet is acknowledged,
there is no connection. That means a malicious attacker can write a
bad TCP implementation that sends out a flood of SYN packets to a
hapless server. The SYN flood is easily mitigated by using IPTABLES
or another netfilter module to drop all incoming connections from an
IP address after a certain volume of traffic is reached for a
certain period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Denial of Service, Distributed Denial of Service is the hardest form
of attack to stop. Companies today are still trying to find good
ways to ease these attacks. This involves sending all sorts of
network traffic forward to servers in the hopes that the traffic
will clog them up and slow down the servers. In big systems, this
can lead to cascading failures. If a system is engineered poorly,
one server’s failure causes all the other servers to pick up more
work which increases the probability that they will fail and so on
and so forth.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="security-at-the-dns-level" class="title-text">Security at the DNS Level</h3>
<p>As of 2019, the United States Department of Homeland Security released a
directive to switch all services from DNS to DNSSec
<a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/assets/report/ed-19-01.pdf" class="fancy-link wiki-link">https://cyber.dhs.gov/assets/report/ed-19-01.pdf</a>.
This directive is an inherent flaw of the DNS system. First, DNS doesn’t
offer any sort of verification on domain name requests. That is, it is
easy to spoof DNS nameservers such that they point your browser to
potentially malicious servers. Remember that DNS requests are sent as
unsecured UDP packets, which are prone to tampering. This means that if
an attacker snags a plain-text request for a DNS server, that attacker
can now send the result back to the requester. More commonly instead of
just attacking one person, they will connect to a public wifi station
and poison the cache of the router – meaning that all who are connected
will get a bad IP address when requesting a domain name. This can get
into serious spoofing attacks if one tries to pretend they are a major
bank.</p>
