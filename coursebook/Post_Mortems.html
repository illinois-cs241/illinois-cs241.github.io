<p><strong>Hindsight is 20-20</strong> - <strong>Unknown</strong></p>

<p>This chapter is meant to serve as a big “why are we learning all of
this”. In all of your previous classes, you were learning what to do.
How to program a data structure, how to code a for loop, how to prove
something. This is the first class that is largely focused on what <em>not</em>
to do. As a result, we draw experience from our past in real ways. Sit
back and scroll through this chapter as we tell you about the problems
of past programmers. Even if you are dealing with something much higher
level like web-development, everything relates back to the system.</p>

<p>This meant that in any system that uses environment variables and
doesn’t sanitize their input (hint no one sanitized environment
variable input because they saw it as safe) you can execute whatever
code you want on other’s machines including setting up a web server.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: On production machines make sure that there is a
minimal operating system (something like BusyBox with DietLibc) so that
you can understand most of the code in the systems and their
effectiveness. Put in multiple layers of abstraction and checks to make
sure that data isn’t leaked. For example the above is a problem insofar
as getting information back to the attackers if it is allowed to
communicate with them. This means that you can harden your machine ports
by disallowing connections on all but a few ports. Also, you can harden
your system to never perform exec calls to perform tasks (i.e. perform
an exec call to update a value) and instead do it in C or your favorite
programming language of choice. Although you don’t have flexibility, you
have peace of mind what you allow users to do.</p>

<p>To put it simply, there were no bounds on buffer checking. The SSL
Heartbeat is super simple. A server sends a string of a certain length,
and the second server is supposed to send the string of the length back.
The problem is someone can maliciously change the size of the request to
larger than what they sent (i.e. send “cat” but request 500 bytes) and
get crucial information like passwords from the server. There is a

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_COW" class="fancy-link wiki-link">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_COW</a></p>
<p>A process usually has access to a set of read-only mappings of memory
that if they try to write to they get a segfault. Dirty COW is a
vulnerability where a bunch of threads attempts to access the same piece
of memory at the same time hoping that one of the threads flips the NX
bit and the writable bit. After that, an attacker can modify the page.
This can be done to the effective user id bit and the process can
pretend it was running as root and spawn a root shell, allowing access
to the system from a normal shell.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: Spinlocks in the kernel are hard.</p>

<p>The mars pathfinder was a mission that tried to collect climate data on
Mars. The finder uses a single bus to communicate with different parts.
Since this was 1997, the hardware itself didn’t have advanced features
like efficient locking so it was up to the operating system developers
to regulate that with mutexes. The architecture was pretty simple. There
was a thread that controlled data along the information bus,
communications thread, and data collection thread in with high, regular,
and low priorities with respect to scheduling. The other caveat is that
if an interrupt happened at some interval and a task is running and a
task is to be scheduled, the task that has the higher priority wins.</p>
<p>The pattern that caused everything to start failing was the data
collection thread starts writing to the bus, the information bus thread
is waiting on the data. Then out the communication thread comes in to
preempt the other lower priority thread <strong>while the lower priority
thread still held the mutex</strong>. This means when the regular priority
thread tried to lock the bus, the rover would deadlock. After some time
the system would reset but isn’t good to leave to chance.</p>
<p>Moral of the lesson? Don’t have the applications themselves deal with
the synchronization. Define a module that handles mutex locking and have
the module communicate through files, IPC, etc.</p>

<p>The short of it is that they ran out of memory. The long of it is that
they ran out of memory, disk space, and swap space. The moral of the
story? Make sure to write code that can handle file failures and can
handle files when they close and go out of memory, so the operating
system can hot swap files to free up memory. Also clean up files, assume
that your temp directory is roughly a hundredth or a thousandth of the
total size and use that.</p>

<p>This is issue that hasn’t happened yet. Unix timestamps are kept as the
number of seconds from a particular day (Jan 1st 1970). This is stored
as a 32 bit signed integer. In March of 2038, this number will overflow.
This isn’t a problem for most modern operating system who store 64 bit
signed integers which is enough to keep us going until the end of time,
but it is a problem for embedded devices that we can’t change the
internal hardware to. Stay tuned to see what happens.</p>

<p>A race condition triggered a series of undefined events in a system that
caused the blackout of most of the northeastern part of North America
for quite some time. This bug also turned off or caused the backup
system and logging systems to fail so people didn’t even know of the bug
for an hour. The exact bits that were flipped are unknown, but patches
have been put into place.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: Modularize your code to localize failures (i.e. keeping
race conditions different between processes). If you need to synchronize
among processes make sure your failure detection system is not
interlaced with your system.</p>

<p>Wonder why we teach string parsing? Because it is a hard thing to do
even for professional software developers. This bug allowed a lot of
undefined behavior when trying to parse a series of unicode characters.
Apple probably knows why this happened, but our guess is that the
parsing of the string happens somewhere inside the kernel and a segfault
is reached. When you get a segfault in the kernel, your kernel panics,
and the entire device reboots. Undefined behavior means anything though,
and a lot of varied things did happen with this bug.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: Fuzz your kernel</p>

<p>Due to a stray goto in Apple’s code, a function always returned that an
SSL certificate was valid. Naturally, hackers were able to get away with
some pretty crazy site names.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: Always bracket if statements, use gotos sparingly.
Chances are if you need to use a goto, write another function or a
switch statement with fall throughs (still bad).</p>

<p>Picture this. It’s 2005, Limewire came a few years prior, the internet
was a growing pool of illegal activities – not to say that is fixed now.
Sony knew that it didn’t have the computing power to police all the
interwebs or get around the various technologies people were using to
get around copyright protection. So what did they do? With 22 million
Music CDs, they required users to install a rootkit on their operating
system, so Sony can monitor the device for unethical activities.</p>
<p>Privacy concerns aside, and believe me there are a lot of them, the big
problem was that this rootkit is a backdoor for everyone’s systems if
programmed incorrectly. A rootkit is a piece of code usually installed
kernel-side that keeps track of almost anything that a user does. What
websites visited, what clicks or keys typed etc. If a hacker finds out
about this and there is a way to access that API from the user space
level, that means any program can find out important information about
your device. Needless to say, people were angry.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: Get an antivirus and/or apparmor and make sure that an
application is only requesting permissions that make sense. If you are
torn, try something like Windows sandbox or keep a Sacrificial VM around
to see if installing it makes your computer horrible. Don’t trust
certificates trust code.</p>

<p>This is probably well known to gamers why someone as (in real life)
non-violent as Ghandi was aggressive in the video game civilization. In
the original, the game kept aggressiveness as an unsigned integer.
During the game, the integer could be decremented and then the problem
ensued because Ghandi was already at zero. This caused him to become the
most aggressive character in the game.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: The take away from this is <strong>never</strong> use unsigned
numbers unless you have an express written reason for it (reasons
include you need to know about the overflow behavior, you are bit
shifting, you are bit masking). In every other case, cast it.</p>

<p>There was a simple bug in Steam that caused Steam to remove all of your
files in the form of something like this</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ ROOT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$0</span>/<span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$PWD</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">rm</span> <span class="nt">-rf</span> <span class="nv">$ROOT</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>What happens if $0 or the first parameter passed into a script doesn’t
exist? You move to root, and you delete your entire computer.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: Do parameter checks, always always always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set -e</code> on a
script and if you expect a command to fail, explicitly list it. You can
also alias rm to mv and then delete the trash later.</p>

<p>Appnexus uses an asynchronous garbage collector that reclaims different
parts of the heap when it believes that objects are unused. The
architecture is that an element is in the unavailable list and then it
is taken out to a to-be-freed list. After a certain time if that element
was unused, it is freed and added to the free list. This is fine until
two thread try to delete the same object at once, adding to the list
twice. After less time, one of the objects was deleted, the delete was
announced to other computers.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: Avoid making hacky software if you need to. Modularize,
and set memory limits, and monitor different parts of your code and
optimize by hand. There is no general catch-all garbage collector that
fits everyone. Even highly tested ones like the JVM need some nudges if
you want to get performance out of them.</p>

<p>The bug is explained well at the link above. We recommend reading to
learn more. A series of network delays that caused some telephone
switches across the country to think that other switches were operable
when they weren’t. When the switches came back online, they realized
they had a huge backlog of calls to route and began doing so. Other
routing failures and restarts only compounded the problem.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned: Not using C would’ve actually helped here because of
more rigorous fuzzing (though C++ in this day and age would be worse
with its language constructs). The real moral of the story is networks
are random and expect any jump at any point in your code. That means
writing simulations and running them with random delays to figure out
bugs before they happen.</p>
