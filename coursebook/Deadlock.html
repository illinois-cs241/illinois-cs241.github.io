<p><strong>No, you can’t always get what you want<br>
You can’t always get what you want<br>
You can’t always get what you want<br>
But if you try sometimes you find<br>
You get what you need</strong> - <strong>The philosophers Jagger &amp; Richards</strong></p>

<p>Deadlock is defined as when a system cannot make any forward progress.
We define a system for the rest of the chapter as a set of rules by
which a set of processes can move from one state to another, where a
state is either working or waiting for a particular resource. Forward
progress is defined as if there is at least one process working or we
can award a process waiting for a resource that resource. In a lot of
systems, Deadlock is avoided by ignoring the entire concept
(Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne
<a href="#ref-silberschatz2006operating" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-silberschatz2006operating</a>,
P.237). Have you heard about turn it on and off again? For products
where the stakes are low (User Operating Systems, Phones), it may be
more efficient to allow deadlock. But in the cases where “failure is not
an option” - Apollo 13, you need a system that tracks, breaks, or
prevents deadlocks. Apollo 13 didn’t fail because of deadlock, but it
wouldn’t be good to restart the system on liftoff.</p>

<p>Mission-critical operating systems need this guarantee formally because
playing the odds with people’s lives isn’t a good idea. Okay so how do
we do this? We model the problem. Even though it is a common statistical
phrase that all models are wrong, the more accurate the model is to the
system the higher the chance the method will work.</p>

<p>One such way is modeling the system with a resource allocation graph
(RAG). A resource allocation graph tracks which resource is held by
which process and which process is waiting for a resource of a
particular type. It is a simple yet powerful tool to illustrate how
interacting processes can deadlock. If a process is <em>using</em> a resource,
an arrow is drawn from the resource node to the process node. If a
process is <em>requesting</em> a resource, an arrow is drawn from the process
node to the resource node. If there is a cycle in the Resource
Allocation Graph and each resource in the cycle provides only one
instance, then the processes will deadlock. For example, if process 1
holds resource A, process 2 holds resource B and process 1 is waiting
for B and process 2 is waiting for A, then processes 1 and 2 will be
deadlocked <a href="#ragfigure" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ragfigure</a>. We’ll make the
distinction that the system is in deadlock by definition if all workers
cannot perform an operation other than waiting. We can detect a deadlock
by traversing the graph and searching for a cycle using a graph
traversal algorithm, such as the Depth First Search (DFS). This graph is
considered as a directed graph and we can treat both the processes and
resources as nodes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-C">    typedef struct {
        int node_id; // Node in this particular graph
        Graph **reachable_nodes; // List of nodes that can be reached from this node
        int size_reachable_nodes; // Size of the List
    } Graph;
    
    // isCyclic() traverses a graph using DFS and detects whether it has a cycle
    // isCyclic() uses a recursive approach
    // G points to a node in a graph, which can be either a resource or a process
    // is_visited is an array indexed with node_id and initialized with zeros (false) to record whether a particular node has been visited
    int isCyclic(Graph *G, int* is_visited) {
        if (this graph has been visited) {
            // Oh! the cycle is found
            return true;
            } else {
            1. Mark this node as visited
            2. Traverse through all nodes in the reachable_nodes
            3. Call isCyclic() for each node
            4. Evaluate the return value of isCyclic()
        }
        // Nope, this graph is acyclic
        return false;
    }

<div class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="content col-sm-11 .col-sm-offset-1">
<p>Surely cycles in RAGs happen all the time in an OS, so why doesn’t it
grind to a halt? You may not see deadlock because the OS may <strong>preempt</strong>
some processes breaking the cycle but there is still a chance that your
three lonely processes could deadlock.</p>
<p>There are four <em>necessary</em> and <em>sufficient</em> conditions for deadlock –
meaning if these conditions hold then there is a non-zero probability
that the system will deadlock at any given iteration. These are known as
the Coffman Conditions (Coffman, Elphick, and Shoshani
<a href="#ref-coffman1971system" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-coffman1971system</a>).</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mutual Exclusion: No two processes can obtain a resource at the same
time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Circular Wait: There exists a cycle in the Resource Allocation
Graph, or there exists a set of processes {P1, P2,…} such that P1 is
waiting for resources held by P2, which is waiting for P3,…, which
is waiting for P1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hold and Wait: Once a resource is obtained, a process keeps the
resource locked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No pre-emption: Nothing can force the process to give up a resource.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(Optional) Proof:</strong><br>
Deadlock can happen if and only if the four Coffman conditions are
satisfied.</p>
<p>\(→\) If the system is deadlocked, the four Coffman conditions are
apparent.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For contradiction, assume that there is no circular wait. If not
then that means the resource allocation graph is acyclic, meaning
that there is at least one process that is not waiting on any
resource to be freed. Since the system can move forward, the system
is not deadlocked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For contradiction, assume that there is no mutual exclusion. If not,
that means that no process is waiting on any other process for a
resource. This breaks circular wait and the previous argument proves
correctness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For contradiction, assume that processes don’t hold and wait but our
system still deadlocks. Since we have circular wait from the first
condition at least one process must be waiting on another process.
If that and processes don’t hold and wait, that means one process
must let go of a resource. Since the system has moved forward, it
cannot be deadlocked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For contradiction, assume that we have preemption, but the system
cannot be un-deadlocked. Have one process, or create one process,
that recognizes the circular wait that must be apparent from above
and break one of the links. By the first branch, we must not have
deadlocked.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>\(←\) If the four conditions are apparent, the system is deadlocked.
We will prove that if the system is not deadlocked, the four conditions
are not apparent. Though this proof is not formal, let us build a system
with the three requirements not including circular wait. Let assume that
there is a set of processes \(P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}\) and there
is a set of resources \(R = \{r_1, r_2, ..., r_m\}\). For simplicity,
a process can only request one resource at a time but the proof can be
generalized to multiple. Let assume that the system is a state at time
\(t\). Let us assume that the state of the system is a tuple
\((h_t, w_t)\) where there are two functions
\(h_t: R →P ∪\{\text{unassigned}\}\) that maps resources to the
processes that own them (this is a function, meaning that we have mutual
exclusion) and or unassigned and \(w_t: P →R ∪\{\text{satisfied}\}\)
that maps the requests that each process makes to a resource or if the
process is satisfied. If the process is satisfied, we consider the work
trivial and the process exits, releasing all resources – this can also
be generalized. Let \(L_t ⊆P ×R\) be a set of lists of requests that a
process uses to release a resource at any given time. The evolution of
the system is at each step at every time.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Release all resources in \(L_t\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a process that is requesting a resource</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that resource is available give it to that process, generating a
new \((h_{t+1}, w_{t+1})\) and exit the current iteration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Else find another process and try the same resource allocation
procedure in the previous step.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If all processes have been surveyed and if all are requesting a resource
and none can be granted a resource, consider it deadlocked. More
formally, this system is deadlocked means if
\(∃t_0, ∀t ≥t_0, ∀p ∈P, w_t(p) ≠\text{satisfied} \text{ and } ∃q, q ≠p →h_t(w_t(p)) = q\)
(which is what we need to prove).</p>
<p>Mutual exclusion and no pre-emption are encoded into the system.
Circular wait implies the second condition, a resource is owned by
another process which is owned by another process meaning at this state
\(∀p ∈P, ∃q ≠p →h_t(w_t(p)) = q\). Circular wait also implies that at
this current state, no process is satisfied, meaning at this state
\(∀p ∈P, w_t(p) ≠\text{satisfied}\). Hold and wait simply proves the
condition that from this point onward, the system will not change, which
is all the conditions that we needed to show.<br>
<strong>(Optional) ■</strong><br>
If a system breaks any of them, it cannot have deadlock! Consider the
scenario where two students need to write both pen and paper and there
is only one of each. Breaking mutual exclusion means that the students
share the pen and paper. Breaking circular wait could be that the
students agree to grab the pen then the paper. As proof by
contradiction, say that deadlock occurs under the rule and the
conditions. Without loss of generality, that means a student would have
to be waiting on a pen while holding the paper and the other waiting on
a pen and holding the paper. We have contradicted ourselves because one
student grabbed the paper without grabbing the pen, so deadlock fails to
occur. Breaking hold and wait could be that the students try to get the
pen and then the paper and if a student fails to grab the paper then
they release the pen. This introduces a new problem called <em>livelock</em>
which will be discussed later. Breaking preemption means that if the two
students are in deadlock the teacher can come in and break up the
deadlock by giving one of the students a held item or tell both students
to put the items down.</p>
<p>livelock relates to deadlock. Consider the breaking hold-and-wait
solution as above. Though deadlock is avoided, if the philosopher picks
up the same device again and again in the same pattern, no work will be
done. Livelock is generally harder to detect because the processes
generally look like they are working to the outside operating system
whereas in deadlock the operating system generally knows when two
processes are waiting on a system-wide resource. Another problem is that
there are necessary conditions for livelock (i.e. deadlock fails to
occur) but not sufficient conditions – meaning there is no set of rules
where livelock has to occur. You must formally prove in a system by what
is known as an invariant. One has to enumerate each of the steps of a
system and if each of the steps eventually – after some finite number of
steps – leads to forward progress, the system fails to livelock. There
are even better systems that prove bounded waits; a system can only be
livelocked for at most \(n\) cycles which may be important for
something like stock exchanges.</p>

<div class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="content col-sm-11 .col-sm-offset-1">
<p>Ignoring deadlock is the most obvious approach. Quite humorously, the
name for this approach is called the ostrich algorithm. Though there is
no apparent source, the idea for the algorithm comes from the concept of
an ostrich sticking its head in the sand. When the operating system
detects deadlock, it does nothing out of the ordinary, and any deadlock
usually goes away. An operating system preempts processes when stopping
them for context switches. The operating system can interrupt any system
call, potentially breaking a deadlock scenario. The OS also makes some
files read-only thus making the resource shareable. What the algorithm
refers to is that if there is an adversary that specifically crafts a
program – or equivalently a user who poorly writes a program – that the
OS deadlocks. For everyday life, this tends to be fine. When it is not
we can turn to the following method.</p>
<p>Deadlock detection allows the system to enter a deadlocked state. After
entering, the system uses the information to break deadlock. As an
example, consider multiple processes accessing files. The operating
system can keep track of all of the files/resources through file
descriptors at some level either abstracted through an API or directly.
If the operating system detects a directed cycle in the operating system
file descriptor table it may break one process’ hold through scheduling
for example and let the system proceed. Why this is a popular choice in
this realm is that there is no way of knowing which resources a program
will select without running the program. This is an extension of Rice’s
theorem (Rice <a href="#ref-rice" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-rice</a>) that says that we
cannot know any semantic feature without running the program (semantic
meaning like what files it tries to open). So theoretically, it is
sound. The problem then gets introduced that we could reach a livelock
scenario if we preempt a set of resources again and again. The way
around this is mostly probabilistic. The operating system chooses a
random resource to break <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hold-and-wait</code>. Now even though a user can
craft a program where breaking hold and wait on each resource will
result in a livelock, this doesn’t happen as often on machines that run
programs in practice or the livelock that does happen happens for a
couple of cycles. These systems are good for products that need to
maintain a non-deadlocked state but can tolerate a small chance of
livelock for a short time.</p>
<p>In addition, we have the <em>Banker’s Algorithm</em>. Which the basic premise
is the bank never runs dry, which prevents livelock. Feel free to check
out the appendix for more details.</p>

Imagine we invite \(n\) (let’s say 6) philosophers to a meal. We will

philosopher must pick up the two chopsticks either side of their

forks, but one can eat with a single fork so we rule this out. However,
these chopsticks are shared with his neighbor.</p>

<p>Is it possible to design an efficient solution such that all
philosophers get to eat? Or, will some philosophers starve, never
obtaining a second chopstick? Or will all of them deadlock? For example,
imagine each guest picks up the chopstick on their left and then waits
for the chopstick on their right to be free. Oops - our philosophers
have deadlocked! Each philosopher is essentially the same, meaning that
each philosopher has the same instruction set based on the other
philosopher i.e. you can’t tell every even philosopher to do one thing
and every odd philosopher to do another thing.</p>

<p>This looks good but. What if everyone picks up their left fork and is
waiting on their right fork? We have deadlocked the program. It is
important to note that deadlock doesn’t happen all the time and the
probability that this solution deadlock goes down as the number of
philosophers goes up. What is important to note is that eventually that
this solution will deadlock, letting threads starve which is bad. Here
is a simple resource allocation graph that shows how the system could be
deadlocked</p>

<p>Now our philosopher picks up the left fork and tries to grab the right.
If it’s available, they eat. If it’s not available, they put the left
fork down and try again. No deadlock! But, there is a problem. What if
all the philosophers pick up their left at the same time, try to grab
their right, put their left down, pick up their left, try to grab their
right and so on. Here is what a time evolution of the system would look
like.</p>

<div class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="content col-sm-11 .col-sm-offset-1">
<p>The naive arbitrator solution has one arbitrator a mutex for example.
Have each of the philosophers ask the arbitrator for permission to eat
or trylock an arbitrator mutex. This solution allows one philosopher to
eat at a time. When they are done, another philosopher can ask for
permission to eat. This prevents deadlock because there is no circular
wait! No philosopher has to wait for any other philosopher. The
advanced arbitrator solution is to implement a class that determines if
the philosopher’s forks are in the arbitrator’s possession. If they are,
they give them to the philosopher, let him eat, and take the forks back.
This has the bonus of being able to have multiple philosophers eat at
the same time.</p>
<p>There are a lot of problems with these solutions. One is that they are
slow and have a single point of failure. Assuming that all the
philosophers are good-willed, the arbitrator needs to be fair. In
practical systems, the arbitrator tends to give forks to the same
processes because of scheduling or pseudo-randomness. Another important
thing to note is that this prevents deadlock for the entire system. But
in our model of dining philosophers, the philosopher has to release the
lock themselves. Then, you can consider the case of the malicious
philosopher (let’s say Descartes because of his Evil Demons) could hold
on to the arbitrator forever. He would make forward progress and the
system would make forward progress but there is no way of ensuring that
each process makes forward progress without assuming something about the
processes or having true preemption – meaning that a higher authority
(let’s say Steve Jobs) tells them to stop eating forcibly.</p>
<p><strong>(Optional) Proof:</strong><br>
The arbitrator solution doesn’t deadlock</p>
<p>The proof is about as simple as it gets. Only one philosopher can
request resources at a time. There is no way to make a cycle in the
resource allocation graph with only one philosopher acting in pickup the
left then the right fork which is what we needed to show.</p>

<h3 id="leaving-the-table-stallings-solution" class="title-text">Leaving the Table (Stallings’ Solution)</h3>
<p>Why does the first solution deadlock? Well, there are \(n\)
philosophers and \(n\) chopsticks. What if there is only 1 philosopher
at the table? Can we deadlock? No. How about 2 philosophers? 3? You can
see where this is going. Stallings’ (Stallings
<a href="#ref-stalling" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-stalling</a> P. 280) solution removes
philosophers from the table until deadlock is not possible – think about
what the magic number of philosophers at the table. The way to do this
in the actual system is through semaphores and letting a certain number
of philosophers through. This has the benefit that multiple philosophers
can be eating.</p>
<p>In the case that the philosophers aren’t evil, this solution requires a
lot of time-consuming context switching. There is also no reliable way
to know the number of resources beforehand. In the dining philosophers
case, this is solved because everything is known but trying to specify
an operating system where a system doesn’t know which file is going to
get opened by what process can lead to a faulty solution. And again
since semaphores are system constructs, they obey system timing clocks
which means that the same processes tend to get added back into the
queue again. Now if a philosopher becomes evil, then the problem becomes
that there is no preemption. A philosopher can eat for as long as they
want and the system will continue to function but that means the
fairness of this solution can be low in the worst case. This works best
with timeouts or forced context switches to ensure bounded wait times.</p>
<p><strong>(Optional) Proof:</strong><br>
Stallings’ Solution Doesn’t Deadlock. Let’s number the philosophers
\(\{p_0, p_1, .., p_{n-1}\}\) and the resources
\(\{r_0, r_1, .., r_{n-1}\}\). A philosopher \(p_i\) needs resource
\(r_{i-1 \mod n}\) and \(r_{i + 1 \mod n}\). Without loss of
generality, let us take \(p_i\) out of the picture. Each resource had
exactly two philosophers that could use it. Now resources
\(r_{i-1 \mod n}\) and \(r_{i + 1 \mod n}\) only have on philosopher
waiting on it. Even if hold and wait, no preemption, and mutual
exclusion or present, the resources can never enter a state where one
philosopher requests them and they are held by another philosopher
because only one philosopher can request them. Since there is no way to
generate a cycle otherwise, circular wait cannot hold. Since circular
wait cannot hold, deadlock cannot happen.<br>
<strong>(Optional) ■</strong><br>
Here is a visualization of the worst-case. The system is about to
deadlock, but the approach resolves it.</p>

<h3 id="partial-ordering-dijkstras-solution" class="title-text">Partial Ordering (Dijkstra’s Solution)</h3>
<p>This is Dijkstra’s solution (Dijkstra,
<a href="#ref-EWD:EWD310" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-EWD:EWD310</a> P. 20). He was the one to
propose this problem on an exam. Why does the first solution deadlock?
Dijkstra thought that the last philosopher who picks up his left fork
(causing the solution to deadlock) should pick up his right. He
accomplishes it by number the forks \(1..n\), and tells each of the
philosophers to pick up his lower number fork. Let’s run through the
deadlock condition again. Everyone tries to pick up their lower number
fork first. Philosopher \(1\) gets fork \(1\), Philosopher \(2\)
gets fork \(2\), and so on until we get to Philosopher \(n\). They
have to choose between fork \(1\) and \(n\). fork \(1\) is already
held up by philosopher \(1\), so they can’t pick up that fork, meaning
he won’t pick up fork \(n\). We have broken <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circular wait</code>! Meaning
deadlock isn’t possible.</p>
<p>Some problems are that an entity either needs to know the finite set of
resources in advance or be able to produce a consistent partial order
such that circular wait cannot happen. This also implies that there
needs to be some entity, either the operating system or another process,
deciding on the number and all of the philosophers need to agree on the
number as new resources come in. As we have also seen with previous
solutions, this relies on context switching. This prioritizes
philosophers that have already eaten but can be made fairer by
introducing random sleeps and waits.</p>
<p><strong>(Optional) Proof:</strong><br>
Dijkstra’s Solution Doesn’t Deadlock</p>
<p>The proof is similar to the previous proof. Let’s number the
philosophers \(\{p_0, p_1, .., p_{n-1}\}\) and the resources
\(\{r_0, r_1, .., r_{n-1}\}\). A philosopher \(p_i\) needs resource
\(r_{i-1 \mod n}\) and \(r_{i + 1 \mod n}\). Each philosopher will
grab \(r_{i-1 \mod n}\) then \(r_{i + 1 \mod n}\) but the last
philosopher will grab in the reverse order. Even if hold and wait, no
preemption, and mutual exclusion or present. Since the last philosopher
will grab \(r_{n-1}\) then \(r_0\) there are two cases either the
philosopher has the first lock or the philosopher doesn’t.</p>
<p>If the last philosopher \(p_{n-1}\) holds the first lock meaning the
previous philosopher \(p_{n-2}\) is waiting on \(r_{n-1}\) meaning
\(r_{n-2}\) is available. Since no other blockers, the philosopher
previous \(p_{n-3}\) will grab her first lock. This is now a reduction
to the previous proof of stalling because we now have \(n\) resources
but only \(n-1\) philosophers, meaning this cannot deadlock.</p>
<p>If the philosopher doesn’t obtain that first lock, then we have a
reduction to Stalling’s proof above because now have \(n-1\)
philosophers vying for \(n\) resources. Since we can’t reach deadlock
in either case, this solution cannot deadlock which is what we needed to
show.</p>
