<p>CPU Scheduling is the problem of efficiently selecting which process to
run on a system’s CPU cores. In a busy system, there will be more
ready-to-run processes than there are CPU cores, so the system kernel
must evaluate which processes should be scheduled to run and which
processes should be executed later. The system must also decide
whetherit should take a particular process and pause its execution –
along with any associated threads. The balance comes from stopping
processes often enough where you have a responsive computer but
infrequently enough where the programs themselves are spending minimal
time context switching. It is a hard balance to get right.</p>

<p>The additional complexity of multi-threaded and multiple CPU cores are
considered a distraction to this initial exposition so are ignored here.
Another gotcha for non-native speakers is the dual meaning of “Time”:
The word “Time” can be used in both clock and elapsed duration context.
For example “The arrival time of the first process was 9:00am.” and,
“The running time of the algorithm is 3 seconds”.</p>

<p>One clarification that we will make is that our scheduling will mainly
deal with short term or CPU scheduling. That means we will assume that
the processes are in memory and ready to go. The other types of
scheduling are long and medium term. Long term schedulers act as
gatekeepers to the processing world. When a process requests another
process to be executed, it can either tell the process yes, no, or wait.
The medium term scheduler deals with the caveats of moving a process
from the paused state in memory to the paused state on disk when there
are too many processes or some process are known to use an insignificant
amount of CPU cycles. Think about a process that only checks something
once an hour.</p>

<p>Schedulers are pieces of software programs. In fact, you can implement
schedulers yourself! If you are given a list of commands to exec, a
program can schedule them them with SIGSTOP and SIGCONT. These are
called user space schedulers. Hadoop and python’s celery may do some
sort of user space scheduling or deal with the operating system.</p>
<p>At the operating system level, you generally have this type of
flowchart, described in words first below. Note, please don’t memorize
all the states.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>New is the initial state. A process has been requested to schedule.
All process requests come from fork or clone. At this point the
operating system knows it needs to create a new process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A process moves from the new state to the ready. This means any
structs in the kernel are allocated. From there, it can go into
ready suspended or running.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running is the state that we hope most of our processes are in,
meaning they are doing useful work. A process could either get
preempted, blocked, or terminate. Preemption brings the process back
to the ready state. If a process is blocked, that means it could be
waiting on a mutex lock, or it could’ve called sleep – either way,
it willingly gave up control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the blocked state the operating system can either turn the
process ready or it can go into a deeper state called blocked
suspended.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are so-called deep slumber states called blocked suspended and
blocked ready. You don’t need to worry about these.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>We will try to pick a scheme that decides when a process should move to
the running state, and when it should be moved back to the ready state.
We won’t make much mention of how to factor in voluntarily blocked
states and when to switch to deep slumber states.</p>

<div class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="content col-sm-11 .col-sm-offset-1">
<p>Scheduling affects the performance of the system, specifically the
<em>latency</em> and <em>throughput</em> of the system. The throughput might be
measured by a system value, for example, the I/O throughput - the number
of bits written per second, or the number of small processes that can
complete per unit time. The latency might be measured by the response
time – elapse time before a process can start to send a response – or
wait time or turnaround time –the elapsed time to complete a task.
Different schedulers offer different optimization trade-offs that may be
appropriate for desired use. There is no optimal scheduler for all
possible environments and goals. For example, Shortest Job First will
minimize total wait time across all jobs but in interactive (UI)
environments it would be preferable to minimize response time at the
expense of some throughput, while FCFS seems intuitively fair and easy
to implement but suffers from the Convoy Effect. Arrival time is the
time at which a process first arrives at the ready queue, and is ready
to start executing. If a CPU is idle, the arrival time would also be the
starting time of execution.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-preemption" class="title-text">What is preemption?</h3>
<p>Without preemption, processes will run until they are unable to utilize
the CPU any further. For example the following conditions would remove a
process from the CPU and the CPU would be available to be scheduled for
other processes. The process terminates due to a signal, is blocked
waiting for concurrency primitive, or exits normally. Thus once a
process is scheduled it will continue even if another process with a
high priority appears on the ready queue.</p>
<p>With preemption, the existing processes may be removed immediately if a
more preferred process is added to the ready queue. For example, suppose
at t=0 with a Shortest Job First scheduler there are two processes (P1
P2) with 10 and 20 ms execution times. P1 is scheduled. P1 immediately
creates a new process P3, with execution time of 5 ms, which is added to
the ready queue. Without preemption, P3 will run 10ms later (after P1
has completed). With preemption, P1 will be immediately evicted from the
CPU and instead placed back in the ready queue, and P3 will be executed
instead by the CPU.</p>
<p>Any scheduler that doesn’t use some form of preemption can result in
starvation because earlier processes may never be scheduled to run
(assigned a CPU). For example with SJF, longer jobs may never be
scheduled if the system continues to have many short jobs to schedule.
It all depends on the

<h3 id="why-might-a-process-or-thread-be-placed-on-the-ready-queue" class="title-text">Why might a process (or thread) be placed on the ready queue?</h3>
<p>A process is placed on the ready queue when it can use a CPU. Some
examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A process was blocked waiting for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/./man3/read.3p.html" class="fancy-link">read</a></code> from storage or socket to
complete and data is now available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new process has been created and is ready to start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A process thread was blocked on a synchronization primitive
(condition variable, semaphore, mutex lock) but is now able to
continue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A process is blocked waiting for a system call to complete but a
signal has been delivered and the signal handler needs to run.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wait Time</code> is the <em>total</em> wait time or the total time that a
process is on the ready queue. A common mistake is to believe it is
only the initial waiting time in the ready queue. If a CPU intensive
process with no I/O takes 7 minutes of CPU time to complete but
required 9 minutes of wall-clock time to complete we can conclude
that it was placed on the ready-queue for 2 minutes. For those 2
minutes, the process was ready to run but had no CPU assigned. It
does not matter when the job was waiting, the wait time is 2
minutes. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end_time - arrival_time - run_time</code></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convoy-effect" class="title-text">Convoy Effect</h3>
<p>The convoy effect is when a process takes up a lot of the CPU time,
leaving all other processes with potentially smaller resource needs
following like a Convoy Behind them.</p>
<p>Suppose the CPU is currently assigned to a CPU intensive task and there
is a set of I/O intensive processes that are in the ready queue. These
processes require a tiny amount of CPU time but they are unable to
proceed because they are waiting for the CPU-intensive task to be
removed from the processor. These processes are starved until the CPU
bound process releases the CPU. But, the CPU will rarely be released.
For example, in the case of an FCFS scheduler, we must wait until the
process is blocked due to an I/O request. The I/O intensive process can
now finally satisfy their CPU needs, which they can do quickly because
their CPU needs are small and the CPU is assigned back to the
CPU-intensive process again. Thus the I/O performance of the whole
system suffers through an indirect effect of starvation of CPU needs of
all processes.</p>
<p>This effect is usually discussed in the context of FCFS scheduler;
however, a Round Robin scheduler can also exhibit the Convoy Effect for
long time-quanta.</p>

<p>The processes all arrive at the start and the scheduler schedules the
job with the shortest total CPU time. The glaring problem is that this
scheduler needs to know how long this program will run over time before
it ran the program.</p>
<p>Technical Note: A realistic SJF implementation would not use the total
execution time of the process but the burst time or the number of CPU
cycles needed to finish a program. The expected burst time can be
estimated by using an exponentially decaying weighted rolling average
based on the previous burst time (Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne
<a href="#ref-silberschatz2005operating" class="fancy-link wiki-link">#ref-silberschatz2005operating</a>
Chapter 6). For this exposition, we will simplify this discussion to use
the total running time of the process as a proxy for the burst time.</p>

<h3 id="preemptive-shortest-job-first-psjf" class="title-text">Preemptive Shortest Job First (PSJF)</h3>
<p>Preemptive shortest job first is like shortest job first but if a new
job comes in with a shorter runtime than the total runtime of the
current job, it is run instead. If it is equal like our example our
algorithm can choose. The scheduler uses the <em>total</em> runtime of the
process. If the scheduler wants to compare the shortest <em>remaining</em> time

(SRTF).</p>

  <li>
    <p>P2 at 0ms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P1 at 1000ms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P5 at 3000ms</p>

  <li>
    <p>P3 at 5000ms</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what our algorithm does. It runs P2 because it is the only thing
to run. Then P1 comes in at 1000ms, P2 runs for 2000ms, so our scheduler
preemptively stops P2, and let’s P1 run all the way through. This is
completely up to the algorithm because the times are equal. Then, P5
Comes in – since no processes running, the scheduler will run process 5.
P4 comes in, and since the runtimes are equal P5, the scheduler stops P5
and runs P4. Finally, P3 comes in, preempts P4, and runs to completion.
Then P4 runs, then P5 runs.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensures shorter jobs get run first</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Need to know the runtime again</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Context switching and jobs can get interrupted</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>P2 at 0ms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P1 at 1000ms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P5 at 3000ms</p>

  <li>
    <p>P3 at 5000ms</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Processes are scheduled in the order of arrival. One advantage of FCFS
is that scheduling algorithm is simple The ready queue is a FIFO (first
in first out) queue. FCFS suffers from the Convoy effect. Here P2
Arrives, then P1 arrives, then P5, then P4, then P3. You can see the
convoy effect for P5.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Simple algorithm and implementation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Context switches infrequent when there are long-running processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No starvation if all processes are guaranteed to terminate</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>

<h3 id="round-robin-rr" class="title-text">Round Robin (RR)</h3>
<p>Processes are scheduled in order of their arrival in the ready queue.
After a small time step though, a running process will be forcibly
removed from the running state and placed back on the ready queue. This
ensures long-running processes refrain from starving all other processes
from running. The maximum amount of time that a process can execute
before being returned to the ready queue is called the time quanta. As
the time quanta approaches to infinity, Round Robin will be equivalent
to FCFS.</p>

Scheduling"></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>P1 Arrival: 0ms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P2 Arrival: 0ms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P3 Arrival: 0ms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P4 Arrival: 0ms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>P5 Arrival: 0ms</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Quantum = 1000ms</p>
<p>Here all processes arrive at the same time. P1 is run for 1 quantum and
is finished. P2 for one quantum; then, it is stopped for P3. After all
other processes run for a quantum we cycle back to P2 until all the
processes are finished.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensures some notion of fairness</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Large number of processes = Lots of switching</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="priority" class="title-text">Priority</h3>
<p>Processes are scheduled in the order of priority value. For example, a
navigation process might be more important to execute than a logging
process.</p>
