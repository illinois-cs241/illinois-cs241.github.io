          Course Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            This course is designed to challenge you as a programmer and new
            computer scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
            Rather than the sand-boxed, contained, and simple problems of your previous courses that
            used significant scaffolding and pre-built libraries, you will be
            interacting with a much more complex environment: the entire system and
            even computing networks. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You will need to fully understand how memory is allocated, used, and re-used within a process. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You will also need to know how input and output can be optionally buffered between
            processes and files. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In short, it is time to remove the training wheels
            off and instead fling open the doors, welcoming you to the big, wide
            world of computing. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Oh, and did we mention the challenge of concurrency
            and solving asynchronous problems, so that your program can take
            advantage of the multi-core CPU inside each machine?
        </p>
