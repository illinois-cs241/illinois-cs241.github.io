## Join the Forum!

We use Ed as the official staff-supported Q&A forum and is the way that we communicate announcements to the rest of the class (e.g., assignment releases, changes to the office hour schedule). If you can't access our forum, ask a member of course staff for the Ed join link.

To get a sense of what's going on and where we are in the course, please read **all** the posts by staff.

## Read the Syllabus

The syllabus is an important read; we find that the answers to many student questions are in the syllabus. Please read the [syllabus](https://cs341.cs.illinois.edu/syllabus.html) thoroughly!

## Assignments

- You can see a list of assignments under the "Assignments" tab. Assignment deadlines are stated on the linked assignment pages.

- Email cs341admin@cs.illinois.edu and say that you have added late (please include the date you added the classes).

If you joining the class after 10 days, then start on the current lab and MP. There will be an opportunity ([regrades](https://cs341.cs.illinois.edu/syllabus.html#regrades)) to address missing grades towards the end of the semester.

You will need to set up/get familiar with the tools necessary to be successful in this course, such as the VM, `ssh`, and `git`. Read the [Development Guide](https://cs341.cs.illinois.edu/tutorials/development) to do so.

The only non-programming assignment in the first few weeks is Homework 0, which is Professor Angrave's introductory mini-course. You will submit your answers for this assignment in the `HW0.md` file in the Luscious Locks lab. See below for the mini-course and "Linux-In-TheBrowser" virtual machine:

- [Mini-courses](https://cs-education.github.io/sys/#/lessons)
- [Virtual Machine](https://cs-education.github.io/sys/#VM)

You can find the questions for Homework 0 in the lecture handout repository corresponding to the current semester on [https://github.com/angrave](https://github.com/angrave).

## Catching up on Material

See the recorded lectures you missed on [ClassTranscribe](https://classtranscribe.illinois.edu/). You can also review content you have missed by reading the [coursebook](https://github.com/cs341-illinois/coursebook/wiki). You can find the lecture handouts in the lecture handout repository corresponding to the current semester on [https://github.com/angrave](https://github.com/angrave). Ask about material you don't understand on the forum, in your lab section, or in office hours!

## Labs

Go to the lab section that you registered for and tell the TA that you added late. We will manually give you attendance until we can update the roster.

## Quizzes

Note that while the PrairieLearn quizzes are due towards the end of the semester, we encourage spacing them out. See the "Quizzes" page and PrairieLearn for more information.
