## Overview

These are *not* the PrairleLearn quizzes that are part of your weekly lab.

There are 7 graded Quizzes available at [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.org/)

Quizzes may be retaken without penality and are due the last day of instruction at UIUC ie. *The day before Reading Day.*

To avoid leaving all quizzes to the last moment we suggest the following due dates -

#### Suggested due dates

Don't stress ... These due dates are not enforced; they are just suggestions to space out quizes over the semeste . You can take and retake the quizes before or after these dates (upto reading day).

* 2021-09-08 Quiz 1 (C foundation)
* 2021-09-22 Quiz 2 (fork,exec,wait and heap)
* 2021-10-09 Quiz 3 (pthreads, producer-consumer, synchronization primitives)
* 2021-10-23 Quiz 4 (threading issues & race conditions, virtual memory)
* 2021-11-06 Quiz 5 (networking and pipes)
* 2021-11-20 Quiz 6 (review -hand picked questions from the above)
* 2021-12-04 Quiz 7 (security)
