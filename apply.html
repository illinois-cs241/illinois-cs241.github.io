			<h1>CS 241 Course Assistant Positions Available!</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Are you interested in becoming a course assistant for CS 241: System Programming? <br/>
				If so, then you should apply for one (or more) of the above positions.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				All positions require dedicated people who have a passion for system programming.<br/>
				Everyone is welcome to apply!<br/>
				Those who submit a promising application will be offered an interview.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Please Keep in mind that the following will probably be working closely together:
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class = "list-group-item">
						Lab Assistants and Office Hours Assistants
					</li>
					<li class = "list-group-item">
						Machine Problem Development and Autograding
					</li>
				</ul>
				So you could easily commit to two teams without too much additional work.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Also note that all role descriptions look more intimidating than they are because of my poor writing and bad CSS. <br/>
				This course is a lot more fun than it is work :)

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<div class="panel panel-default">
			 	<div class="panel-body">
			 		UIUC CS has wide variety of talent ranging from those who know more than all the instructors combined to those who are still learning to use the terminal.
					And at some point almost all of these students come to office hours to get extra help.
					Whether it be drawing figures on the whiteboard or stepping through GDB, the labor of a Office Hour Assistant is priceless.
					In fact, few things are more rewarding than helping a student understand and to help them develop a passion for the subject you teach.

						Most of the times, you can fill the gap in a student's understanding of the material just by remembering why you struggled with the material and what helped you understand it.
						However, some students might not get the material even after the third time you explained it to them.
						This is where patience comes into play, since you probably just have to think of another way of explaining the material to them.

					Writing Machine Problems involves coming up with a meaningful assignments where students can not only apply their knowledge, but also learn.
					Writing these assignments involves a lot of time drafting on whiteboards and bouncing ideas.
					As you are writing these assignments you will have to ask yourself "What am I trying to have the students learn?".
					Students are very busy and you can not give MPs that take 35 hrs and have them spend a bunch of time doing string manipulation (unless that is the intent of the assignment).

					Last semesters we had a couple of projects which included ClassTranscribe and Markdown2PDF.
					ClassTranscribe took static lecture videos and transcribed them, so that students can easily find the content they desire.
					Markdown2PDF took the already popular CS241 WikiBook and automated the process of converting it to a PDF, so that students can have a physical copy of the most up to date wikibook.

			 		This translates to honor's students being the most knowledge hungry and our pickiest customers.
			 		They will except a section that pushes the bounds of a system programming course and you will be responsible for providing exactly that.
			 		Unlike the rest of the course, material and content will be geared toward the A and A+ students.
			 		You will interact with students that match and may surpass your intelligence and the thought of this should excite you.
			 		If you have a deep passion for systems and want to instill that passion in the course's 1%, then this is the position for you.

			 		If you do not want to develop content and do lab sections or office hours, but want to answer 2000+ piazza questions, then by you should by all means apply for course staff.
